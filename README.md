# Medical Imaging using PyTorch
This repository some of our learning projects on Deep learning and Computer vision in Medical imaging

The impact of deep learning in the field of Medical sciences is immense. We are lucky that we find ourselves at the crux where so much development is happening in this field.

## Purpose
1. This repository contains our learnings while working medical imaging datasets using Pytorch and other libraries
2. While learning we found it very difficult where to start and what direction to take as there is an information bubble out there. Lot of good work including papers/github repo/libraries are there and lot of beginners get confused on how to proceed. We hope ths repo will help new learners by giving them some direction on how to go about exploring medical imaging
